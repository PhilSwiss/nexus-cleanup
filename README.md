Nexus-Cleanup
=============

Remove old releases from a Maven2-repository in Nexus3

This Groovy-script will purge old versions (sorted by version-number) from a [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) repository hosted on [Nexus 3.x](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss).

You can set the desired repository and a maximum amount of versions at the begining of this script.

Optional: define a retention (in days), so that old versions are only deleted if they are older than the retention.


Information
===========

After upgrading from Nexus 2.x to Nexus 3.x, the build-in function for keeping the latest X releases was sadly gone.
Ofcourse there is an ongoing [feature-request](https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/NEXUS-10821) for that.
 
I tried the [script](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45894920) by [Matt Harrison](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1267396/matt-harrison) from StackOverflow for this problem, but the migration-tool in Nexus had reset all _last_updated_-values to the date of the migration, sad again.
 
Now I tried to sort the releases by version via *'ORDER BY version DESC'*, but that resulted in a mess,
where a version **3.9.0** is newer than **3.11.0** and so on, not a suitable scenario.

In the end, I forked [Matt Harrison's script](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45894920) and the nice [logoutput](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57604767) by [Neil201](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5998653/neil201)

Added some helper-lists and the [VersionComperator](https://gist.github.com/founddrama/971284) (a version sorter) by [Rob Friesel](https://gist.github.com/founddrama)

Finally, I linted the script with [npm-groovy-lint](https://github.com/nvuillam/npm-groovy-lint) to get a cleaner code, somehow

I later included the retention-feature kindly provided by [agronlun](https://github.com/agronlun) and some cleanup/optimization by [emetriqChris](https://github.com/emetriqChris)


Installation
============

1. add the line **nexus.scripts.allowCreation=true** to *$data-dir/etc/nexus.properties*
2. restart the *Nexus*-service, to apply the changes
3. in the webinterface of Nexus, go to *Administration* > *Tasks* and create a new *Execute script*-task
4. configure the task by filling out the required fields (Task name, Task frequency, etc.)
5. copy 'n' paste all lines from **nexus-cleanup.groovy** into the *Source*-field
6. disable further script creation, by adding a leading *#*-character to the line from step 1.
7. restart the *Nexus*-service, once again
